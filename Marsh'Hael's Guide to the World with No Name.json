The chosen creature gains a {@dice d4}, which it can choose to add to its AC for the attack if the triggering roll was an attack against them, or otherwise may add it to the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.",
